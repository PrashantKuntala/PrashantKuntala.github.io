  <p>Hi, I'm Prashant. </p>

  <p> I design and develop large scale genomic applications with integrated data visualizations to better understand gene regulation and protein interactions. <br> I create and maintain conda packages for bioinformatic software on <a href="https://bioconda.github.io/"> bioconda.</a></p>

  <p>My work as a Computational Scientist in <a href="http://pughlab.mbg.cornell.edu/"> Frank Pugh's lab</a> was focused on building Galaxy based high-throughput analysis pipelines that leverages high performance computing and to design and build web infrastructure for knowledge discovery platforms.</p>

  <p> I am interested in tools and applications that combine data visualization, data mining, deep learning and the Web.</p>
