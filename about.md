Hi :wave: -- I'm Prashant Kumar Kuntala.

I'm currently working as a computational scientist in [Dr. Frank Pugh's lab](https://pughlab.psu.edu) at [Pennsylvania State University](https://psu.edu) building tools that combine [HPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer), Bioinformatics Platforms [(Galaxy)](https://usegalaxy.org/), Web technologies and Containerization tools to effectively analyze and visualize epigenetic and Next Generation Sequencing [(NGS)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3841808/).

I am an open-source enthusiast, web developer and a computational biologist. I'm interested in deep learning, data visualization and web. This website serves as a place to document my pursuits to understand the genome using computational tools.
